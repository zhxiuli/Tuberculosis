A0A024CIM4	BCHE	Butyrylcholinesterase; Esterase with broad substrate specificity. Contributes to the inactivation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Can degrade neurotoxic organophosphate esters	100 %	1250
B2R9V7	SOD3	Superoxide dismutase 3, extracellular; Protect the extracellular space from toxic effect of reactive oxygen intermediates by converting superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen	100 %	489
B2RBZ5	SERPINA10	Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 10; Inhibits activity of the coagulation protease factor Xa in the presence of PROZ, calcium and phospholipids. Also inhibits factor XIa in the absence of cofactors	99 %	909
B4DE84	HERC2	HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2; E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates ubiquitin- dependent retention of repair proteins on damaged chromosomes. Recruited to sites of DNA damage in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and facilitates the assembly of UBE2N and RNF8 promoting DNA damage-induced formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. Acts as a mediator of binding specificity between UBE2N and RNF8. Involved in the maintenance of RNF168 levels. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of XPA which infl [...] 	96 %	898
B4E1C2	KNG1	Kininogen 1; (1) Kininogens are inhibitors of thiol proteases; (2) HMW-kininogen plays an important role in blood coagulation by helping to position optimally prekallikrein and factor XI next to factor XII; (3) HMW-kininogen inhibits the thrombin- and plasmin- induced aggregation of thrombocytes; (4) the active peptide bradykinin that is released from HMW-kininogen shows a variety of physiological effects: (4A) influence in smooth muscle contraction, (4B) induction of hypotension, (4C) natriuresis and diuresis, (4D) decrease in blood glucose level, (4E) it is a mediator of inflammation [...] 	100 %	1344
B7Z7M2	PZP	Pregnancy-zone protein; Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique 'trapping' mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the c [...] 	96 %	259
D6REY1	CHIT1	Chitinase 1 (chitotriosidase); Degrades chitin, chitotriose and chitobiose. May participate in the defense against nematodes and other pathogens. Isoform 3 has no enzymatic activity	98 %	716
E5RIF9	CA1	Carbonic anhydrase I; Reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. Can hydrates cyanamide to urea	100 %	308
H7C0N0	ITIH1	Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 1; May act as a carrier of hyaluronan in serum or as a binding protein between hyaluronan and other matrix protein, including those on cell surfaces in tissues to regulate the localization, synthesis and degradation of hyaluronan which are essential to cells undergoing biological processes	99 %	959
M0R2W8	PGLYRP2	Peptidoglycan recognition protein 2; May play a scavenger role by digesting biologically active peptidoglycan (PGN) into biologically inactive fragments. Has no direct bacteriolytic activity	100 %	288
P30046	DDT	D-dopachrome tautomerase; Tautomerization of D-dopachrome with decarboxylation to give 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI)	100 %	241
Q9H5Q8	SNX25	Sorting nexin 25; May be involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking	99 %	709
S6B294	IGKV3D-7	Uncharacterized protein 	61 %	122
V9H0D6	C4B	Complement component 4B (Chido blood group); Non-enzymatic component of the C3 and C5 convertases and thus essential for the propagation of the classical complement pathway. Covalently binds to immunoglobulins and immune complexes and enhances the solubilization of immune aggregates and the clearance of IC through CR1 on erythrocytes. C4A isotype is responsible for effective binding to form amide bonds with immune aggregates or protein antigens, while C4B isotype catalyzes the transacylation of the thioester carbonyl group to form ester bonds with carbohydrate antigens	100 %	81.6
